''' The rules used by Pig Latin are as follows:
If a word begins with a vowel, just as "yay" to
the end. For example, "out" is translated into "outyay".
If it begins with a consonant, then we take all consonants
before the first vowel and we put them on the end of the word.

''' way to consolidate some of these 4 loops?'''
